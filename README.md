# Programming-Fundamentals-and-Unit-Testing-September-2024
The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in the professional modules of automated testing. Learners build on the knowledge gained in the QA Fundamentals (Manual) module and begin to learn basic programming skills such as basic coding skills, working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while), component testing. The course will also study basic programming structures such as arrays and sheets. The course successfully builds an idea among the trainees about the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful "automated software testing" specialists.
